- 👋 Hi, I’m Christian Kim, I created this github after following Maxx Potential's recommendation for "Introduction to the Command Line" and "Make a Website". While I am a beginner and only have a basic level knowledge of html and css, I am always willing to improve. Also I have never used python before, or built a python based web application before this, but I believe having a growth mindset and building new skills will help me in the long run! I hope you enjoy my website and the steps I have taken along the way to build it. 
- 👀 I’m currently interested in developing my HTML, CSS, Django, and Cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve some of my skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Django website.
- 📫 How to reach me. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I first developed my love for technology as a kid because my mom would always ask me for help with her computer. Everytime I would help her, I would teach her skills and knowledge so that she wouldn't always rely on my help. Throughout the years she has developed the skills and ability to operate her computer, ipad, and iphone by herself. She now uses the skills she has developed to act as her church's mission group leader. She does all the planning, operating, scheduling, financing (collecting and paying for hotels, air bnb's rental cars, and flights). The growth mindset and willingness to learn have always been a part of what I believe makes not only a successful I.T professional, but also a sucessful overall person!
