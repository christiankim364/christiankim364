👋 Hi, I'm Christian Kim! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I initially created this GitHub following Maxx Potential's recommended resources such as "Introduction to the Command Line" and "Make a Website." I have experience building web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, SQL, Python, and Django, and I'm committed to continuously improving and expanding my skills.

To enhance my web development expertise, I've completed the HTML/CSS and JavaScript courses by SuperSimpleDev, and I've challenged myself to recreate Maxx Potential's website. I'm actively documenting my learning journey, including challenges and solutions, in both PowerPoint presentations and Word documents.

👀 Currently, I'm interested in further developing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, SQL, and Cybersecurity. I'm also studying to obtain my CompTIA Security+ certification.

🌱 I am consistently looking for new resources and opportunities to advance my technical skills and knowledge.

💞️ I'm open to collaboration, especially on Django-based web applications or any projects involving cybersecurity. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together or share ideas!

📫 You can contact me through my GitHub profile.

⚡ Fun Fact (How I developed a love for technology): My passion for technology started during childhood when I frequently assisted my mom with her computer issues. I enjoyed not only fixing her problems but teaching her skills so she could independently handle her technology. Over the years, she grew proficient enough to manage her computer, iPad, and iPhone by herself, eventually becoming the leader of her church’s mission group. Her technological competence now enables her to efficiently plan and manage various logistical details like scheduling, budgeting, and coordinating travels. Additionally, Eric Barone, creator of "Stardew Valley," inspired me to pursue personal projects passionately and consistently, demonstrating the value of dedication and perseverance.

Currently, I'm exploring cybersecurity through real-world job simulators on Forage.com, gaining practical experience and skills to prepare for professional roles. I hope you'll follow along with me on this exciting journey!
